                Queues are fundamental to many algorithms and processes in computer science. Their FIFO nature is essential in tasks like task scheduling, resource management, and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms. They provide efficient data handling for linear tasks where order is crucial, such as print job management and process scheduling in operating systems.
